#Ask the user for the two int values to compre
x = int(input("What's X? "))
y = int(input("What's Y? "))

#Now that we have the values we can compare
#We use the keyword to ask the question

if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")

#This statement only happens when x < y, so we need more statments

if x > y:
    print("x is greater than x")

if x == y:
    print("x is equal")

# This is great however,
# no matter what result we get, we always have to ask 3 time.
